# Facebook MCP Server

This project is a **MCP server** for automating and managing interactions on a Facebook Page using the Facebook Graph API. It exposes tools to create posts, moderate comments, fetch post insights, and filter negative feedback ‚Äî ready to plug into Claude, or other LLM-based agents.

It was developed starting from "@HagaiHen/facebook-mcp-server" but we want to push it directly to pip as a package

---

## ü§ñ What Is This?

This MCP provides a suite of AI-callable tools that connect directly to a Facebook Page, abstracting common API operations as LLM-friendly functions.

### ‚úÖ Benefits

- Empowers **social media managers** to automate moderation and analytics.
- Seamlessly integrates with **any Agent client**.
- Enables fine-grained control over Facebook content from natural language.
